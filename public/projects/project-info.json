        "brief": "A limited pen tool that allows the user to add points on a Bezier spline and manipulate them with control points. Created using OpenGl for Python.",
        "description": "This project was the third assignment in my 3rd year computer graphics course. The goal of the assignment was to build this spline tool that connects all points with a Bezier Curve - a line with 2 end points that can be manipulated by 2 intermediate control points made up of 200 connected line segments to simulate the curve. Staring with an empty screen, a mouse click will add an endpoint to the screen, connecting it to the nearest unconnected endpoint. Once 2 endpoints are connected control points will appear that can be used to manipulate the curve. Endpoints and control points can be clicked and moved with the mouse, pressing 'E' will erase the screen. At a higher level Bezier Curves can be used to simulate smooth lines whether it be for mapping character animations in gaming, computer graphics or developing CAD software. ",

        "description": "This project was the forth assignment in my 3rd year graphics course and one of my first C++ programs. The goal for the assignment was to create an OpenGl program that reads points and faces from multiple .ply files (that were provided) that were then turned into a VAO (Vertex Array Object) that could be used by OpenGl to render the meshes. There were also provided .bmp files that matched with each triangular mesh object, these .bmps were used to add texture to the meshes, giving them their color and design along with fragment and vertex shaders. As we were learning about different camera types at this point in the course, we were also required to implement a first person POV camera that can be freely moved around the generated meshes. GLFW was used to handle this, the up and down arrow keys move the camera position forwards/backwards while the left/right keys will rotate the camera around a centre axis.",

        "brief": "A C++ OpenGl project that uses the marching cubes algorithm to display a 3D mathamatical function, complete with lighting shaders and the ability to manipulate the view arounda spherical point.",
        "description": "This was my 5th assignment in my 3rd year computer graphics course. The goal of the assignment was as follows, use the marching cubes algorithm on an aribtrary scalar field, mimick lighting with a shader, have the view matrix rotate around an origin and write triangle mesh data to a file. The Marching Cubes algorithm creates a 3D surface from volumetric data by breaking the space into cubes and checking which parts of each cube are inside or outside a threshold. It finds where the surface cuts through each cube's edges, uses a pre-made table to decide how to connect those points into triangles, and then combines all the triangles into a smooth 3D shape. The algorithm is widely used in medical imaging to create 3D models of organs or bones from CT and MRI scan data, helping doctors visualize internal structures. The spherical cooridnates system was used to implement the rotating camera, focusued around an origin at the centre of the function drawing. The shaders work together to implement a Phong-like lighting: the vertex shader calculates transformed positions, normals, and light direction for each vertex, while the fragment shader computes ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to create realistic shading on the object's surface. There are 2 default functions implemented into the program that can be used: f1 ( y - sin(x)cos(z) ) and f2 (x^2 - y^2 - z^2 - z) which is shown in the demo. Other variables that can be manipulated by the user are min and max ( minimum and maximum values, boudries for the surronding cube), stepsize ( side length of each marching cube ), isovalue ( if a value of a point is greater than isovalue it is considered to be inside the cube, less than and it is outside of the cube ) light ( direction of the incoming light source ) and colour ( colour of the function ).

        "description": "This was the 6th and final assignment in my computer graphics course. This assignment focused more on the shaders than anything else, using tessalation on a plane quad mesh to then manipulate it with a geometry shader to create waves, a historically challenging problem in computer graphics. The first shader used is a vertex shader which calculates values like eye and light direction, vertices in world coordinates and UV coordinates. Tesselation control and evaluation shaders split the quad meshes into finer quads and then passes in interpolated values into the geometetry shader. The geometry shader uses the formula for Gerstner waves to add depth ( using a displacement map ) to the fine meshes, combining waves that will collide over time. The final step is in the fragment shader where ambient, specular and diffuse lighting components that have been edited over the shader program are applied to the mesh, giving it a lighting effect. Textures are also added to the waves to simulate the look of the water moving while the waves flow. This was by far the most challenging assignment in the course but helped me to learn a lot about different shaders and how they are used in rendering graphics. Similar to the TriangleMesh assignment, spherical coordinates are used to look around the waves.",
